//Write a method isLeapYear with a parameter of type int named year. 
//The parameter needs to be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 9999.
//
//If the parameter is not in that range return false. 
//
//Otherwise, if it is in the valid range, calculate if the year is a leap year and return true if it is, otherwise return false. 
//
//A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or it is divisible by 400.
//
//Examples of input/output:
//
//isLeapYear(-1600); should return false since parameter is not in the range (1-9999)
//isLeapYear(1600); should return true since 1600 is leap year
//isLeapYear(2017); should return false since 2017 is not a leap year
//isLeapYear(2000); should return true because 2000 is a leap year 
//NOTE: The isLeapYear method needs to be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course. 
//NOTE: Do not add a  main method to solution code.
